INTRODUCTION
============

regxmllib is a collection of tools and low-level libraries for the creation of 
RegXML (SMPTE ST 2001-1) representations of MXF header metadata
(SMPTE ST 377-1). 

regxmllib is implemented in pure Java. Netbeans 8.0 is used for development.

ARCHITECTURE
============

At the heart of regxmllib is the FragmentBuilder.fragmentFromTriplet() method
that creates an XML fragment from a KLV group given a context consisting of
a RegXML metadictionary and a collection of KLV groups from which strong
references are resolved. The rules engine implement in 
FragmentBuilder.fragmentFromTriplet() is intended to follow the rules specified
in ST 2001-1 as closely as possible.

The RegXML dictionary can be read from an XML file or created from SMPTE 
Metadata Registers.

The SMPTE Metadata Registers can be read from a set of XML files or imported 
from the latest SMPTE Register draft (as an Excel spreadsheet.)

regxmllib includes a minimal MXF and KLV parser.

TOOLS
=====

RegXMLDump: dumps either the first Essence Descriptor or the entire header
            metadata of an MXF file as a RegXML structure
            
XLSRegistersToXML: converts SMPTE registers contained in a spreadsheet to an
                   XML-based representation.
                   
XMLRegistersToDict: converts XML-based registers to a RegXML metadictionary

GenerateXMLSchemaDocuments: generates XSDs for the Registers
                            created by XLSRegistersToXML
                            
GenerateDictionaryXMLSchema: generate XSDs from the RegXML metadictionaries


BUILD TARGETS
=============

build-regxml-schemas: generates a RegXML XSDs at /schemas/dict based on
                      the output of build-regxml-dict

build-xml-registers: generates XML-based Registers at /register based on
                     the contents of /input/register/csv or 
                     /input/register/xml (if present) (see DEPENDENCIES)
                     
build-regxml-dict: generates RegXML Metadictionaries at /dict
                   based on the ouput of build-xml-registers
                   
build-register-schemas: generates at /schemas/register the XSDs for the
                        Registers created by build-xml-registers

                                        by the build script

DEPENDENCIES
============

The build system expects one of the following file sets to be present under
"/input/register". These files are used to generate corresponding XML Registers
(under "/register") and, ultimately, the RegXML MetaDictionaries at 
"/dict".

- under /input/register/csv

    groups-smpte-ra-frozen-20140304.2118.csv
    labels-smpte-ra-frozen-20140304.2118.csv
    types-smpte-ra-frozen-20140304.2118.csv
    elements-smpte-ra-frozen-20140304.2118.csv

    These files are generated by exporting as CSV the four registers at [1].

- under /input/register/xml (preferentially)

    ElementsRegister.xml
    GroupsRegister.xml
    TypesRegister.xml
    LabelsRegister.xml
    
    These files must conform to the schemas under /schemas/register
    
    They cen be generated from the BBC database
