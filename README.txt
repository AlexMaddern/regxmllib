INTRODUCTION
============

regxmllib is a collection of tools and low-level libraries for the creation of 
RegXML (SMPTE ST 2001-1) representations of MXF header metadata
(SMPTE ST 377-1). 

regxmllib is implemented in pure Java. Netbeans 8.0 is used for development.

ARCHITECTURE
============

At the heart of regxmllib is the FragmentBuilder.fragmentFromTriplet() method
that creates an XML fragment from a KLV group given a context consisting of
a RegXML metadictionary and a collection of KLV groups from which strong
references are resolved. The rules engine implement in 
FragmentBuilder.fragmentFromTriplet() is intended to follow the rules specified
in ST 2001-1 as closely as possible.

The RegXML dictionary can be read from an XML file or created from SMPTE 
Metadata Registers.

The SMPTE Metadata Registers can be read from a set of XML files or imported 
from the latest SMPTE Register draft (as an Excel spreadsheet.)

regxmllib includes a minimal MXF and KLV parser.

=============================

/regxmllib                              Source code and build artifacts

                                        dictionaries used by the library

/register                               Stub directory containing the XML
                                        Registers used and generated by the
                                        library 

/register/input                         Stub directory for source CSV registers 
                                        extracted from [1]
           
           
DEPENDENCIES
============

The build system expects the following files to be present under
"register/input". These files are used to generate corresponding XML Registers
(under "/register") and, ultimately, the RegXML MetaDictionary at 
"/dict/regxml.xml".

groups-smpte-ra-frozen-20140304.2118.csv
labels-smpte-ra-frozen-20140304.2118.csv
types-smpte-ra-frozen-20140304.2118.csv
elements-smpte-ra-frozen-20140304.2118.csv

These files are generated by exporting as CSV the four registers at [1].
